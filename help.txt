<p>The purpose of this web app is to aid you in memorizing scripture. The approach I use
here is based on one I read about years ago where rather than repeating a Bible Verse over
and over and over in hopes that you will remember it, we act more strategically and actually
practice REMEMBERING the verse instead of repeating it. In my experience, this leads to
faster memorization for less effort.<p>

<p>Here is how you use this program: The upper section has the controls that you use to 
select the Bible Verse you want to memorize. It also includes a "Hide/Unhide" button to
hide the complete text, or if you are struggling to remember part of the verse to "Unhide"
the text so you can re-read it. The verse is shown in the middle section of this page.</p>

<p>Then, in the bottom section we have the abbreviated verse - it shows the first letter
of each word in the verse as well as the punctuation. The idea is that once you have read over
the verse a few times, you can hide the verse and then try to recall the verse, using these
first letters of each word as a hint to help you practice remembering.</p>

<p>Then, as you grow in confidence, you can increase the "Mask" to hide some of the
abbreviated letters so that you can challenge yourself to remember more of the verse without
the hint provided by the first letter of each word. If you find yourself struggling, you
can decrease the Mask in order to see what some of those letters were again.</p>

<p>Presently, this web-app only uses the public-domain King James Version of the Bible.
If there is enough interest, I may look into adding other translations that are free to use
in this way. Unfortunately, due to their copyright status, I am unable to legally provide
most newer translations of the Bible for use with this web-app.</p>

<p>If you want to tinker with this web-app, the source will shortly be available on git-hub.</p>
