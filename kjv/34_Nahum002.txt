He that dasheth in pieces is come up before thy face
For the LORD hath turned away the excellency of Jacob, as the excellency of Israel
The shield of his mighty men is made red, the valiant men are in scarlet
The chariots shall rage in the streets, they shall justle one against another in the broad ways
He shall recount his worthies
The gates of the rivers shall be opened, and the palace shall be dissolved.
And Huzzab shall be led away captive, she shall be brought up, and her maids shall lead her as with the voice of doves, tabering upon their breasts.
But Nineveh is of old like a pool of water
Take ye the spoil of silver, take the spoil of gold
She is empty, and void, and waste
Where is the dwelling of the lions, and the feedingplace of the young lions, where the lion, even the old lion, walked, and the lion's whelp, and none made them afraid?
The lion did tear in pieces enough for his whelps, and strangled for his lionesses, and filled his holes with prey, and his dens with ravin.
Behold, I am against thee, saith the LORD of hosts, and I will burn her chariots in the smoke, and the sword shall devour thy young lions
