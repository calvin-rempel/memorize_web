When a man hath taken a wife, and married her, and it come to pass that she find no favour in his eyes, because he hath found some uncleanness in her
And when she is departed out of his house, she may go and be another man's wife.
And if the latter husband hate her, and write her a bill of divorcement, and giveth it in her hand, and sendeth her out of his house; or if the latter husband die, which took her to be his wife;
Her former husband, which sent her away, may not take her again to be his wife, after that she is defiled; for that is abomination before the LORD
When a man hath taken a new wife, he shall not go out to war, neither shall he be charged with any business
No man shall take the nether or the upper millstone to pledge
If a man be found stealing any of his brethren of the children of Israel, and maketh merchandise of him, or selleth him; then that thief shall die; and thou shalt put evil away from among you.
Take heed in the plague of leprosy, that thou observe diligently, and do according to all that the priests the Levites shall teach you
Remember what the LORD thy God did unto Miriam by the way, after that ye were come forth out of Egypt.
When thou dost lend thy brother any thing, thou shalt not go into his house to fetch his pledge.
Thou shalt stand abroad, and the man to whom thou dost lend shall bring out the pledge abroad unto thee.
And if the man be poor, thou shalt not sleep with his pledge
In any case thou shalt deliver him the pledge again when the sun goeth down, that he may sleep in his own raiment, and bless thee
Thou shalt not oppress an hired servant that is poor and needy, whether he be of thy brethren, or of thy strangers that are in thy land within thy gates
At his day thou shalt give him his hire, neither shall the sun go down upon it; for he is poor, and setteth his heart upon it
The fathers shall not be put to death for the children, neither shall the children be put to death for the fathers
Thou shalt not pervert the judgment of the stranger, nor of the fatherless; nor take a widow's raiment to pledge
But thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in Egypt, and the LORD thy God redeemed thee thence
When thou cuttest down thine harvest in thy field, and hast forgot a sheaf in the field, thou shalt not go again to fetch it
When thou beatest thine olive tree, thou shalt not go over the boughs again
When thou gatherest the grapes of thy vineyard, thou shalt not glean it afterward
And thou shalt remember that thou wast a bondman in the land of Egypt
