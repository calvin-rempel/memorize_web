Praise waiteth for thee, O God, in Sion
O thou that hearest prayer, unto thee shall all flesh come.
Iniquities prevail against me
Blessed is the man whom thou choosest, and causest to approach unto thee, that he may dwell in thy courts
By terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our salvation; who art the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the sea
Which by his strength setteth fast the mountains; being girded with power
Which stilleth the noise of the seas, the noise of their waves, and the tumult of the people.
They also that dwell in the uttermost parts are afraid at thy tokens
Thou visitest the earth, and waterest it
Thou waterest the ridges thereof abundantly
Thou crownest the year with thy goodness; and thy paths drop fatness.
They drop upon the pastures of the wilderness
The pastures are clothed with flocks; the valleys also are covered over with corn; they shout for joy, they also sing.
