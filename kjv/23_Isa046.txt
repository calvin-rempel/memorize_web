Bel boweth down, Nebo stoopeth, their idols were upon the beasts, and upon the cattle
They stoop, they bow down together; they could not deliver the burden, but themselves are gone into captivity.
Hearken unto me, O house of Jacob, and all the remnant of the house of Israel, which are borne by me from the belly, which are carried from the womb
And even to your old age I am he; and even to hoar hairs will I carry you
To whom will ye liken me, and make me equal, and compare me, that we may be like?
They lavish gold out of the bag, and weigh silver in the balance, and hire a goldsmith; and he maketh it a god
They bear him upon the shoulder, they carry him, and set him in his place, and he standeth; from his place shall he not remove
Remember this, and shew yourselves men
Remember the former things of old
Declaring the end from the beginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, saying, My counsel shall stand, and I will do all my pleasure
Calling a ravenous bird from the east, the man that executeth my counsel from a far country
Hearken unto me, ye stouthearted, that are far from righteousness
I bring near my righteousness; it shall not be far off, and my salvation shall not tarry
