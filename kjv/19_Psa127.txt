Except the LORD build the house, they labour in vain that build it
It is vain for you to rise up early, to sit up late, to eat the bread of sorrows
Lo, children are an heritage of the LORD
As arrows are in the hand of a mighty man; so are children of the youth.
Happy is the man that hath his quiver full of them
