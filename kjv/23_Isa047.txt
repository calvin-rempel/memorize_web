Come down, and sit in the dust, O virgin daughter of Babylon, sit on the ground
Take the millstones, and grind meal
Thy nakedness shall be uncovered, yea, thy shame shall be seen
As for our redeemer, the LORD of hosts is his name, the Holy One of Israel.
Sit thou silent, and get thee into darkness, O daughter of the Chaldeans
I was wroth with my people, I have polluted mine inheritance, and given them into thine hand
And thou saidst, I shall be a lady for ever
Therefore hear now this, thou that art given to pleasures, that dwellest carelessly, that sayest in thine heart, I am, and none else beside me; I shall not sit as a widow, neither shall I know the loss of children
But these two things shall come to thee in a moment in one day, the loss of children, and widowhood
For thou hast trusted in thy wickedness
Therefore shall evil come upon thee; thou shalt not know from whence it riseth
Stand now with thine enchantments, and with the multitude of thy sorceries, wherein thou hast laboured from thy youth; if so be thou shalt be able to profit, if so be thou mayest prevail.
Thou art wearied in the multitude of thy counsels. Let now the astrologers, the stargazers, the monthly prognosticators, stand up, and save thee from these things that shall come upon thee.
Behold, they shall be as stubble; the fire shall burn them; they shall not deliver themselves from the power of the flame
Thus shall they be unto thee with whom thou hast laboured, even thy merchants, from thy youth
