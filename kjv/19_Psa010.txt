Why standest thou afar off, O LORD? why hidest thou thyself in times of trouble?
The wicked in his pride doth persecute the poor
For the wicked boasteth of his heart's desire, and blesseth the covetous, whom the LORD abhorreth.
The wicked, through the pride of his countenance, will not seek after God
His ways are always grievous; thy judgments are far above out of his sight
He hath said in his heart, I shall not be moved
His mouth is full of cursing and deceit and fraud
He sitteth in the lurking places of the villages
He lieth in wait secretly as a lion in his den
He croucheth, and humbleth himself, that the poor may fall by his strong ones.
He hath said in his heart, God hath forgotten
Arise, O LORD; O God, lift up thine hand
Wherefore doth the wicked contemn God? he hath said in his heart, Thou wilt not require it.
Thou hast seen it; for thou beholdest mischief and spite, to requite it with thy hand
Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man
The LORD is King for ever and ever
LORD, thou hast heard the desire of the humble
To judge the fatherless and the oppressed, that the man of the earth may no more oppress.
