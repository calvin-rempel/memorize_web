Hear ye this, O priests; and hearken, ye house of Israel; and give ye ear, O house of the king; for judgment is toward you, because ye have been a snare on Mizpah, and a net spread upon Tabor.
And the revolters are profound to make slaughter, though I have been a rebuker of them all.
I know Ephraim, and Israel is not hid from me
They will not frame their doings to turn unto their God
And the pride of Israel doth testify to his face
They shall go with their flocks and with their herds to seek the LORD; but they shall not find him; he hath withdrawn himself from them.
They have dealt treacherously against the LORD
Blow ye the cornet in Gibeah, and the trumpet in Ramah
Ephraim shall be desolate in the day of rebuke
The princes of Judah were like them that remove the bound
Ephraim is oppressed and broken in judgment, because he willingly walked after the commandment.
Therefore will I be unto Ephraim as a moth, and to the house of Judah as rottenness.
When Ephraim saw his sickness, and Judah saw his wound, then went Ephraim to the Assyrian, and sent to king Jareb
For I will be unto Ephraim as a lion, and as a young lion to the house of Judah
I will go and return to my place, till they acknowledge their offence, and seek my face
