Blessed is he that considereth the poor
The LORD will preserve him, and keep him alive; and he shall be blessed upon the earth
The LORD will strengthen him upon the bed of languishing
I said, LORD, be merciful unto me
Mine enemies speak evil of me, When shall he die, and his name perish?
And if he come to see me, he speaketh vanity
All that hate me whisper together against me
An evil disease, say they, cleaveth fast unto him
Yea, mine own familiar friend, in whom I trusted, which did eat of my bread, hath lifted up his heel against me.
But thou, O LORD, be merciful unto me, and raise me up, that I may requite them.
By this I know that thou favourest me, because mine enemy doth not triumph over me.
And as for me, thou upholdest me in mine integrity, and settest me before thy face for ever.
Blessed be the LORD God of Israel from everlasting, and to everlasting. Amen, and Amen.
