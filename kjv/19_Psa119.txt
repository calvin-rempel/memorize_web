Blessed are the undefiled in the way, who walk in the law of the LORD.
Blessed are they that keep his testimonies, and that seek him with the whole heart.
They also do no iniquity
Thou hast commanded us to keep thy precepts diligently.
O that my ways were directed to keep thy statutes!
Then shall I not be ashamed, when I have respect unto all thy commandments.
I will praise thee with uprightness of heart, when I shall have learned thy righteous judgments.
I will keep thy statutes
Wherewithal shall a young man cleanse his way? by taking heed thereto according to thy word.
With my whole heart have I sought thee
Thy word have I hid in mine heart, that I might not sin against thee.
Blessed art thou, O LORD
With my lips have I declared all the judgments of thy mouth.
I have rejoiced in the way of thy testimonies, as much as in all riches.
I will meditate in thy precepts, and have respect unto thy ways.
I will delight myself in thy statutes
Deal bountifully with thy servant, that I may live, and keep thy word.
Open thou mine eyes, that I may behold wondrous things out of thy law.
I am a stranger in the earth
My soul breaketh for the longing that it hath unto thy judgments at all times.
Thou hast rebuked the proud that are cursed, which do err from thy commandments.
Remove from me reproach and contempt; for I have kept thy testimonies.
Princes also did sit and speak against me
Thy testimonies also are my delight and my counsellors.
My soul cleaveth unto the dust
I have declared my ways, and thou heardest me
Make me to understand the way of thy precepts
My soul melteth for heaviness
Remove from me the way of lying
I have chosen the way of truth
I have stuck unto thy testimonies
I will run the way of thy commandments, when thou shalt enlarge my heart.
Teach me, O LORD, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end.
Give me understanding, and I shall keep thy law; yea, I shall observe it with my whole heart.
Make me to go in the path of thy commandments; for therein do I delight.
Incline my heart unto thy testimonies, and not to covetousness.
Turn away mine eyes from beholding vanity; and quicken thou me in thy way.
Stablish thy word unto thy servant, who is devoted to thy fear.
Turn away my reproach which I fear
Behold, I have longed after thy precepts
Let thy mercies come also unto me, O LORD, even thy salvation, according to thy word.
So shall I have wherewith to answer him that reproacheth me
And take not the word of truth utterly out of my mouth; for I have hoped in thy judgments.
So shall I keep thy law continually for ever and ever.
And I will walk at liberty
I will speak of thy testimonies also before kings, and will not be ashamed.
And I will delight myself in thy commandments, which I have loved.
My hands also will I lift up unto thy commandments, which I have loved; and I will meditate in thy statutes.
Remember the word unto thy servant, upon which thou hast caused me to hope.
This is my comfort in my affliction
The proud have had me greatly in derision
I remembered thy judgments of old, O LORD; and have comforted myself.
Horror hath taken hold upon me because of the wicked that forsake thy law.
Thy statutes have been my songs in the house of my pilgrimage.
I have remembered thy name, O LORD, in the night, and have kept thy law.
This I had, because I kept thy precepts.
Thou art my portion, O LORD
I intreated thy favour with my whole heart
I thought on my ways, and turned my feet unto thy testimonies.
I made haste, and delayed not to keep thy commandments.
The bands of the wicked have robbed me
At midnight I will rise to give thanks unto thee because of thy righteous judgments.
I am a companion of all them that fear thee, and of them that keep thy precepts.
The earth, O LORD, is full of thy mercy
Thou hast dealt well with thy servant, O LORD, according unto thy word.
Teach me good judgment and knowledge
Before I was afflicted I went astray
Thou art good, and doest good; teach me thy statutes.
The proud have forged a lie against me
Their heart is as fat as grease; but I delight in thy law.
It is good for me that I have been afflicted; that I might learn thy statutes.
The law of thy mouth is better unto me than thousands of gold and silver.
Thy hands have made me and fashioned me
They that fear thee will be glad when they see me; because I have hoped in thy word.
I know, O LORD, that thy judgments are right, and that thou in faithfulness hast afflicted me.
Let, I pray thee, thy merciful kindness be for my comfort, according to thy word unto thy servant.
Let thy tender mercies come unto me, that I may live
Let the proud be ashamed; for they dealt perversely with me without a cause
Let those that fear thee turn unto me, and those that have known thy testimonies.
Let my heart be sound in thy statutes; that I be not ashamed.
My soul fainteth for thy salvation
Mine eyes fail for thy word, saying, When wilt thou comfort me?
For I am become like a bottle in the smoke; yet do I not forget thy statutes.
How many are the days of thy servant? when wilt thou execute judgment on them that persecute me?
The proud have digged pits for me, which are not after thy law.
All thy commandments are faithful
They had almost consumed me upon earth; but I forsook not thy precepts.
Quicken me after thy lovingkindness; so shall I keep the testimony of thy mouth.
For ever, O LORD, thy word is settled in heaven.
Thy faithfulness is unto all generations
They continue this day according to thine ordinances
Unless thy law had been my delights, I should then have perished in mine affliction.
I will never forget thy precepts
I am thine, save me; for I have sought thy precepts.
The wicked have waited for me to destroy me
I have seen an end of all perfection
O how love I thy law! it is my meditation all the day.
Thou through thy commandments hast made me wiser than mine enemies
I have more understanding than all my teachers
I understand more than the ancients, because I keep thy precepts.
I have refrained my feet from every evil way, that I might keep thy word.
I have not departed from thy judgments
How sweet are thy words unto my taste! yea, sweeter than honey to my mouth!
Through thy precepts I get understanding
Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.
I have sworn, and I will perform it, that I will keep thy righteous judgments.
I am afflicted very much
Accept, I beseech thee, the freewill offerings of my mouth, O LORD, and teach me thy judgments.
My soul is continually in my hand
The wicked have laid a snare for me
Thy testimonies have I taken as an heritage for ever
I have inclined mine heart to perform thy statutes alway, even unto the end.
I hate vain thoughts
Thou art my hiding place and my shield
Depart from me, ye evildoers
Uphold me according unto thy word, that I may live
Hold thou me up, and I shall be safe
Thou hast trodden down all them that err from thy statutes
Thou puttest away all the wicked of the earth like dross
My flesh trembleth for fear of thee; and I am afraid of thy judgments.
I have done judgment and justice
Be surety for thy servant for good
Mine eyes fail for thy salvation, and for the word of thy righteousness.
Deal with thy servant according unto thy mercy, and teach me thy statutes.
I am thy servant; give me understanding, that I may know thy testimonies.
It is time for thee, LORD, to work
Therefore I love thy commandments above gold; yea, above fine gold.
Therefore I esteem all thy precepts concerning all things to be right; and I hate every false way.
Thy testimonies are wonderful
The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.
I opened my mouth, and panted
Look thou upon me, and be merciful unto me, as thou usest to do unto those that love thy name.
Order my steps in thy word
Deliver me from the oppression of man
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant; and teach me thy statutes.
Rivers of waters run down mine eyes, because they keep not thy law.
Righteous art thou, O LORD, and upright are thy judgments.
Thy testimonies that thou hast commanded are righteous and very faithful.
My zeal hath consumed me, because mine enemies have forgotten thy words.
Thy word is very pure
I am small and despised
Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness, and thy law is the truth.
Trouble and anguish have taken hold on me
The righteousness of thy testimonies is everlasting
I cried with my whole heart; hear me, O LORD
I cried unto thee; save me, and I shall keep thy testimonies.
I prevented the dawning of the morning, and cried
Mine eyes prevent the night watches, that I might meditate in thy word.
Hear my voice according unto thy lovingkindness
They draw nigh that follow after mischief
Thou art near, O LORD; and all thy commandments are truth.
Concerning thy testimonies, I have known of old that thou hast founded them for ever.
Consider mine affliction, and deliver me
Plead my cause, and deliver me
Salvation is far from the wicked
Great are thy tender mercies, O LORD
Many are my persecutors and mine enemies; yet do I not decline from thy testimonies.
I beheld the transgressors, and was grieved; because they kept not thy word.
Consider how I love thy precepts
Thy word is true from the beginning
Princes have persecuted me without a cause
I rejoice at thy word, as one that findeth great spoil.
I hate and abhor lying
Seven times a day do I praise thee because of thy righteous judgments.
Great peace have they which love thy law
LORD, I have hoped for thy salvation, and done thy commandments.
My soul hath kept thy testimonies; and I love them exceedingly.
I have kept thy precepts and thy testimonies
Let my cry come near before thee, O LORD
Let my supplication come before thee
My lips shall utter praise, when thou hast taught me thy statutes.
My tongue shall speak of thy word
Let thine hand help me; for I have chosen thy precepts.
I have longed for thy salvation, O LORD; and thy law is my delight.
Let my soul live, and it shall praise thee; and let thy judgments help me.
I have gone astray like a lost sheep; seek thy servant; for I do not forget thy commandments.
