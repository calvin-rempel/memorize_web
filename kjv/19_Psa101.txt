I will sing of mercy and judgment
I will behave myself wisely in a perfect way. O when wilt thou come unto me? I will walk within my house with a perfect heart.
I will set no wicked thing before mine eyes
A froward heart shall depart from me
Whoso privily slandereth his neighbour, him will I cut off
Mine eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, that they may dwell with me
He that worketh deceit shall not dwell within my house
I will early destroy all the wicked of the land; that I may cut off all wicked doers from the city of the LORD.
