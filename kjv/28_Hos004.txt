Hear the word of the LORD, ye children of Israel
By swearing, and lying, and killing, and stealing, and committing adultery, they break out, and blood toucheth blood.
Therefore shall the land mourn, and every one that dwelleth therein shall languish, with the beasts of the field, and with the fowls of heaven; yea, the fishes of the sea also shall be taken away.
Yet let no man strive, nor reprove another
Therefore shalt thou fall in the day, and the prophet also shall fall with thee in the night, and I will destroy thy mother.
My people are destroyed for lack of knowledge
As they were increased, so they sinned against me
They eat up the sin of my people, and they set their heart on their iniquity.
And there shall be, like people, like priest
For they shall eat, and not have enough
Whoredom and wine and new wine take away the heart.
My people ask counsel at their stocks, and their staff declareth unto them
They sacrifice upon the tops of the mountains, and burn incense upon the hills, under oaks and poplars and elms, because the shadow thereof is good
I will not punish your daughters when they commit whoredom, nor your spouses when they commit adultery
Though thou, Israel, play the harlot, yet let not Judah offend; and come not ye unto Gilgal, neither go ye up to Bethaven, nor swear, The LORD liveth.
For Israel slideth back as a backsliding heifer
Ephraim is joined to idols
Their drink is sour
The wind hath bound her up in her wings, and they shall be ashamed because of their sacrifices.
