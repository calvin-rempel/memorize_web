O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good
O give thanks unto the God of gods
O give thanks to the Lord of lords
To him who alone doeth great wonders
To him that by wisdom made the heavens
To him that stretched out the earth above the waters
To him that made great lights
The sun to rule by day
The moon and stars to rule by night
To him that smote Egypt in their firstborn
And brought out Israel from among them
With a strong hand, and with a stretched out arm
To him which divided the Red sea into parts
And made Israel to pass through the midst of it
But overthrew Pharaoh and his host in the Red sea
To him which led his people through the wilderness
To him which smote great kings
And slew famous kings
Sihon king of the Amorites
And Og the king of Bashan
And gave their land for an heritage
Even an heritage unto Israel his servant
Who remembered us in our low estate
And hath redeemed us from our enemies
Who giveth food to all flesh
O give thanks unto the God of heaven
