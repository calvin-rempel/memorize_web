Praise ye the LORD. Blessed is the man that feareth the LORD, that delighteth greatly in his commandments.
His seed shall be mighty upon earth
Wealth and riches shall be in his house
Unto the upright there ariseth light in the darkness
A good man sheweth favour, and lendeth
Surely he shall not be moved for ever
He shall not be afraid of evil tidings
His heart is established, he shall not be afraid, until he see his desire upon his enemies.
He hath dispersed, he hath given to the poor; his righteousness endureth for ever; his horn shall be exalted with honour.
The wicked shall see it, and be grieved; he shall gnash with his teeth, and melt away
