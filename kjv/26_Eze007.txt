Moreover the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,
Also, thou son of man, thus saith the Lord GOD unto the land of Israel; An end, the end is come upon the four corners of the land.
Now is the end come upon thee, and I will send mine anger upon thee, and will judge thee according to thy ways, and will recompense upon thee all thine abominations.
And mine eye shall not spare thee, neither will I have pity
Thus saith the Lord GOD; An evil, an only evil, behold, is come.
An end is come, the end is come
The morning is come unto thee, O thou that dwellest in the land
Now will I shortly pour out my fury upon thee, and accomplish mine anger upon thee
And mine eye shall not spare, neither will I have pity
Behold the day, behold, it is come
Violence is risen up into a rod of wickedness
The time is come, the day draweth near
For the seller shall not return to that which is sold, although they were yet alive
They have blown the trumpet, even to make all ready; but none goeth to the battle
The sword is without, and the pestilence and the famine within
But they that escape of them shall escape, and shall be on the mountains like doves of the valleys, all of them mourning, every one for his iniquity.
All hands shall be feeble, and all knees shall be weak as water.
They shall also gird themselves with sackcloth, and horror shall cover them; and shame shall be upon all faces, and baldness upon all their heads.
They shall cast their silver in the streets, and their gold shall be removed
As for the beauty of his ornament, he set it in majesty
And I will give it into the hands of the strangers for a prey, and to the wicked of the earth for a spoil; and they shall pollute it.
My face will I turn also from them, and they shall pollute my secret place
Make a chain
Wherefore I will bring the worst of the heathen, and they shall possess their houses
Destruction cometh; and they shall seek peace, and there shall be none.
Mischief shall come upon mischief, and rumour shall be upon rumour; then shall they seek a vision of the prophet; but the law shall perish from the priest, and counsel from the ancients.
The king shall mourn, and the prince shall be clothed with desolation, and the hands of the people of the land shall be troubled
