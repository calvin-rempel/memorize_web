O LORD, rebuke me not in thy wrath
For thine arrows stick fast in me, and thy hand presseth me sore.
There is no soundness in my flesh because of thine anger; neither is there any rest in my bones because of my sin.
For mine iniquities are gone over mine head
My wounds stink and are corrupt because of my foolishness.
I am troubled; I am bowed down greatly; I go mourning all the day long.
For my loins are filled with a loathsome disease
I am feeble and sore broken
Lord, all my desire is before thee; and my groaning is not hid from thee.
My heart panteth, my strength faileth me
My lovers and my friends stand aloof from my sore; and my kinsmen stand afar off.
They also that seek after my life lay snares for me
But I, as a deaf man, heard not; and I was as a dumb man that openeth not his mouth.
Thus I was as a man that heareth not, and in whose mouth are no reproofs.
For in thee, O LORD, do I hope
For I said, Hear me, lest otherwise they should rejoice over me
For I am ready to halt, and my sorrow is continually before me.
For I will declare mine iniquity; I will be sorry for my sin.
But mine enemies are lively, and they are strong
They also that render evil for good are mine adversaries; because I follow the thing that good is.
Forsake me not, O LORD
Make haste to help me, O Lord my salvation.
