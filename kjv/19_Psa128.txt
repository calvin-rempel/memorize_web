Blessed is every one that feareth the LORD; that walketh in his ways.
For thou shalt eat the labour of thine hands
Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine by the sides of thine house
Behold, that thus shall the man be blessed that feareth the LORD.
The LORD shall bless thee out of Zion
Yea, thou shalt see thy children's children, and peace upon Israel.
