O Israel, return unto the LORD thy God; for thou hast fallen by thine iniquity.
Take with you words, and turn to the LORD
Asshur shall not save us; we will not ride upon horses
I will heal their backsliding, I will love them freely
I will be as the dew unto Israel
His branches shall spread, and his beauty shall be as the olive tree, and his smell as Lebanon.
They that dwell under his shadow shall return; they shall revive as the corn, and grow as the vine
Ephraim shall say, What have I to do any more with idols? I have heard him, and observed him
Who is wise, and he shall understand these things? prudent, and he shall know them? for the ways of the LORD are right, and the just shall walk in them
