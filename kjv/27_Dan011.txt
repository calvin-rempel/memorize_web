Also I in the first year of Darius the Mede, even I, stood to confirm and to strengthen him.
And now will I shew thee the truth. Behold, there shall stand up yet three kings in Persia; and the fourth shall be far richer than they all
And a mighty king shall stand up, that shall rule with great dominion, and do according to his will.
And when he shall stand up, his kingdom shall be broken, and shall be divided toward the four winds of heaven; and not to his posterity, nor according to his dominion which he ruled
And the king of the south shall be strong, and one of his princes; and he shall be strong above him, and have dominion; his dominion shall be a great dominion.
And in the end of years they shall join themselves together; for the king's daughter of the south shall come to the king of the north to make an agreement
But out of a branch of her roots shall one stand up in his estate, which shall come with an army, and shall enter into the fortress of the king of the north, and shall deal against them, and shall prevail
And shall also carry captives into Egypt their gods, with their princes, and with their precious vessels of silver and of gold; and he shall continue more years than the king of the north.
So the king of the south shall come into his kingdom, and shall return into his own land.
But his sons shall be stirred up, and shall assemble a multitude of great forces
And the king of the south shall be moved with choler, and shall come forth and fight with him, even with the king of the north
And when he hath taken away the multitude, his heart shall be lifted up; and he shall cast down many ten thousands
For the king of the north shall return, and shall set forth a multitude greater than the former, and shall certainly come after certain years with a great army and with much riches.
And in those times there shall many stand up against the king of the south
So the king of the north shall come, and cast up a mount, and take the most fenced cities
But he that cometh against him shall do according to his own will, and none shall stand before him
He shall also set his face to enter with the strength of his whole kingdom, and upright ones with him; thus shall he do
After this shall he turn his face unto the isles, and shall take many
Then he shall turn his face toward the fort of his own land
Then shall stand up in his estate a raiser of taxes in the glory of the kingdom
And in his estate shall stand up a vile person, to whom they shall not give the honour of the kingdom
And with the arms of a flood shall they be overflown from before him, and shall be broken; yea, also the prince of the covenant.
And after the league made with him he shall work deceitfully
He shall enter peaceably even upon the fattest places of the province; and he shall do that which his fathers have not done, nor his fathers' fathers; he shall scatter among them the prey, and spoil, and riches
And he shall stir up his power and his courage against the king of the south with a great army; and the king of the south shall be stirred up to battle with a very great and mighty army; but he shall not stand
Yea, they that feed of the portion of his meat shall destroy him, and his army shall overflow
And both these kings' hearts shall be to do mischief, and they shall speak lies at one table; but it shall not prosper
Then shall he return into his land with great riches; and his heart shall be against the holy covenant; and he shall do exploits, and return to his own land.
At the time appointed he shall return, and come toward the south; but it shall not be as the former, or as the latter.
For the ships of Chittim shall come against him
And arms shall stand on his part, and they shall pollute the sanctuary of strength, and shall take away the daily sacrifice, and they shall place the abomination that maketh desolate.
And such as do wickedly against the covenant shall he corrupt by flatteries
And they that understand among the people shall instruct many
Now when they shall fall, they shall be holpen with a little help
And some of them of understanding shall fall, to try them, and to purge, and to make them white, even to the time of the end
And the king shall do according to his will; and he shall exalt himself, and magnify himself above every god, and shall speak marvellous things against the God of gods, and shall prosper till the indignation be accomplished
Neither shall he regard the God of his fathers, nor the desire of women, nor regard any god
But in his estate shall he honour the God of forces
Thus shall he do in the most strong holds with a strange god, whom he shall acknowledge and increase with glory
And at the time of the end shall the king of the south push at him
He shall enter also into the glorious land, and many countries shall be overthrown
He shall stretch forth his hand also upon the countries
But he shall have power over the treasures of gold and of silver, and over all the precious things of Egypt
But tidings out of the east and out of the north shall trouble him
And he shall plant the tabernacles of his palace between the seas in the glorious holy mountain; yet he shall come to his end, and none shall help him.
