Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, unto thee do we give thanks
When I shall receive the congregation I will judge uprightly.
The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved
I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly
Lift not up your horn on high
For promotion cometh neither from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.
But God is the judge
For in the hand of the LORD there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture; and he poureth out of the same
But I will declare for ever; I will sing praises to the God of Jacob.
All the horns of the wicked also will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous shall be exalted.
