Praise ye the LORD. Praise ye the LORD from the heavens
Praise ye him, all his angels
Praise ye him, sun and moon
Praise him, ye heavens of heavens, and ye waters that be above the heavens.
Let them praise the name of the LORD
He hath also stablished them for ever and ever
Praise the LORD from the earth, ye dragons, and all deeps
Fire, and hail; snow, and vapours; stormy wind fulfilling his word
Mountains, and all hills; fruitful trees, and all cedars
Beasts, and all cattle; creeping things, and flying fowl
Kings of the earth, and all people; princes, and all judges of the earth
Both young men, and maidens; old men, and children
Let them praise the name of the LORD
He also exalteth the horn of his people, the praise of all his saints; even of the children of Israel, a people near unto him. Praise ye the LORD.
