Have mercy upon me, O God, according to thy lovingkindness
Wash me throughly from mine iniquity, and cleanse me from my sin.
For I acknowledge my transgressions
Against thee, thee only, have I sinned, and done this evil in thy sight
Behold, I was shapen in iniquity; and in sin did my mother conceive me.
Behold, thou desirest truth in the inward parts
Purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean
Make me to hear joy and gladness; that the bones which thou hast broken may rejoice.
Hide thy face from my sins, and blot out all mine iniquities.
Create in me a clean heart, O God; and renew a right spirit within me.
Cast me not away from thy presence; and take not thy holy spirit from me.
Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation; and uphold me with thy free spirit.
Then will I teach transgressors thy ways; and sinners shall be converted unto thee.
Deliver me from bloodguiltiness, O God, thou God of my salvation
O Lord, open thou my lips; and my mouth shall shew forth thy praise.
For thou desirest not sacrifice; else would I give it
The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit
Do good in thy good pleasure unto Zion
Then shalt thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering
