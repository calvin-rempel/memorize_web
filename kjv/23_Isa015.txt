The burden of Moab. Because in the night Ar of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence; because in the night Kir of Moab is laid waste, and brought to silence;
He is gone up to Bajith, and to Dibon, the high places, to weep
In their streets they shall gird themselves with sackcloth
And Heshbon shall cry, and Elealeh
My heart shall cry out for Moab; his fugitives shall flee unto Zoar, an heifer of three years old
For the waters of Nimrim shall be desolate
Therefore the abundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the brook of the willows.
For the cry is gone round about the borders of Moab; the howling thereof unto Eglaim, and the howling thereof unto Beerelim.
For the waters of Dimon shall be full of blood
