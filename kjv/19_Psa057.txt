Be merciful unto me, O God, be merciful unto me
I will cry unto God most high; unto God that performeth all things for me.
He shall send from heaven, and save me from the reproach of him that would swallow me up. Selah. God shall send forth his mercy and his truth.
My soul is among lions
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens; let thy glory be above all the earth.
They have prepared a net for my steps; my soul is bowed down
My heart is fixed, O God, my heart is fixed
Awake up, my glory; awake, psaltery and harp
I will praise thee, O Lord, among the people
For thy mercy is great unto the heavens, and thy truth unto the clouds.
Be thou exalted, O God, above the heavens
