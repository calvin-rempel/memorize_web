Hear my cry, O God; attend unto my prayer.
From the end of the earth will I cry unto thee, when my heart is overwhelmed
For thou hast been a shelter for me, and a strong tower from the enemy.
I will abide in thy tabernacle for ever
For thou, O God, hast heard my vows
Thou wilt prolong the king's life
He shall abide before God for ever
So will I sing praise unto thy name for ever, that I may daily perform my vows.
