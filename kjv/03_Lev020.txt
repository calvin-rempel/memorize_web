And the LORD spake unto Moses, saying,
Again, thou shalt say to the children of Israel, Whosoever he be of the children of Israel, or of the strangers that sojourn in Israel, that giveth any of his seed unto Molech; he shall surely be put to death
And I will set my face against that man, and will cut him off from among his people; because he hath given of his seed unto Molech, to defile my sanctuary, and to profane my holy name.
And if the people of the land do any ways hide their eyes from the man, when he giveth of his seed unto Molech, and kill him not
Then I will set my face against that man, and against his family, and will cut him off, and all that go a whoring after him, to commit whoredom with Molech, from among their people.
And the soul that turneth after such as have familiar spirits, and after wizards, to go a whoring after them, I will even set my face against that soul, and will cut him off from among his people.
Sanctify yourselves therefore, and be ye holy
And ye shall keep my statutes, and do them
For every one that curseth his father or his mother shall be surely put to death
And the man that committeth adultery with another man's wife, even he that committeth adultery with his neighbour's wife, the adulterer and the adulteress shall surely be put to death.
And the man that lieth with his father's wife hath uncovered his father's nakedness
And if a man lie with his daughter in law, both of them shall surely be put to death
If a man also lie with mankind, as he lieth with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination
And if a man take a wife and her mother, it is wickedness
And if a man lie with a beast, he shall surely be put to death
And if a woman approach unto any beast, and lie down thereto, thou shalt kill the woman, and the beast
And if a man shall take his sister, his father's daughter, or his mother's daughter, and see her nakedness, and she see his nakedness; it is a wicked thing; and they shall be cut off in the sight of their people
And if a man shall lie with a woman having her sickness, and shall uncover her nakedness; he hath discovered her fountain, and she hath uncovered the fountain of her blood
And thou shalt not uncover the nakedness of thy mother's sister, nor of thy father's sister
And if a man shall lie with his uncle's wife, he hath uncovered his uncle's nakedness
And if a man shall take his brother's wife, it is an unclean thing
Ye shall therefore keep all my statutes, and all my judgments, and do them
And ye shall not walk in the manners of the nation, which I cast out before you
But I have said unto you, Ye shall inherit their land, and I will give it unto you to possess it, a land that floweth with milk and honey
Ye shall therefore put difference between clean beasts and unclean, and between unclean fowls and clean
And ye shall be holy unto me
A man also or woman that hath a familiar spirit, or that is a wizard, shall surely be put to death
