Plead my cause, O LORD, with them that strive with me
Take hold of shield and buckler, and stand up for mine help.
Draw out also the spear, and stop the way against them that persecute me
Let them be confounded and put to shame that seek after my soul
Let them be as chaff before the wind
Let their way be dark and slippery
For without cause have they hid for me their net in a pit, which without cause they have digged for my soul.
Let destruction come upon him at unawares; and let his net that he hath hid catch himself
And my soul shall be joyful in the LORD
All my bones shall say, LORD, who is like unto thee, which deliverest the poor from him that is too strong for him, yea, the poor and the needy from him that spoileth him?
False witnesses did rise up; they laid to my charge things that I knew not.
They rewarded me evil for good to the spoiling of my soul.
But as for me, when they were sick, my clothing was sackcloth
I behaved myself as though he had been my friend or brother
But in mine adversity they rejoiced, and gathered themselves together
With hypocritical mockers in feasts, they gnashed upon me with their teeth.
Lord, how long wilt thou look on? rescue my soul from their destructions, my darling from the lions.
I will give thee thanks in the great congregation
Let not them that are mine enemies wrongfully rejoice over me
For they speak not peace
Yea, they opened their mouth wide against me, and said, Aha, aha, our eye hath seen it.
This thou hast seen, O LORD
Stir up thyself, and awake to my judgment, even unto my cause, my God and my Lord.
Judge me, O LORD my God, according to thy righteousness; and let them not rejoice over me.
Let them not say in their hearts, Ah, so would we have it
Let them be ashamed and brought to confusion together that rejoice at mine hurt
Let them shout for joy, and be glad, that favour my righteous cause
And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness and of thy praise all the day long.
