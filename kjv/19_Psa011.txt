In the LORD put I my trust
For, lo, the wicked bend their bow, they make ready their arrow upon the string, that they may privily shoot at the upright in heart.
If the foundations be destroyed, what can the righteous do?
The LORD is in his holy temple, the LORD's throne is in heaven
The LORD trieth the righteous
Upon the wicked he shall rain snares, fire and brimstone, and an horrible tempest
For the righteous LORD loveth righteousness; his countenance doth behold the upright.
