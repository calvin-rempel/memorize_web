In thee, O LORD, do I put my trust; let me never be ashamed
Bow down thine ear to me; deliver me speedily
For thou art my rock and my fortress; therefore for thy name's sake lead me, and guide me.
Pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me
Into thine hand I commit my spirit
I have hated them that regard lying vanities
I will be glad and rejoice in thy mercy
And hast not shut me up into the hand of the enemy
Have mercy upon me, O LORD, for I am in trouble
For my life is spent with grief, and my years with sighing
I was a reproach among all mine enemies, but especially among my neighbours, and a fear to mine acquaintance
I am forgotten as a dead man out of mind
For I have heard the slander of many
But I trusted in thee, O LORD
My times are in thy hand
Make thy face to shine upon thy servant
Let me not be ashamed, O LORD; for I have called upon thee
Let the lying lips be put to silence; which speak grievous things proudly and contemptuously against the righteous.
Oh how great is thy goodness, which thou hast laid up for them that fear thee; which thou hast wrought for them that trust in thee before the sons of men!
Thou shalt hide them in the secret of thy presence from the pride of man
Blessed be the LORD
For I said in my haste, I am cut off from before thine eyes
O love the LORD, all ye his saints
Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, all ye that hope in the LORD.
