Preserve me, O God
O my soul, thou hast said unto the LORD, Thou art my Lord
But to the saints that are in the earth, and to the excellent, in whom is all my delight.
Their sorrows shall be multiplied that hasten after another god
The LORD is the portion of mine inheritance and of my cup
The lines are fallen unto me in pleasant places; yea, I have a goodly heritage.
I will bless the LORD, who hath given me counsel
I have set the LORD always before me
Therefore my heart is glad, and my glory rejoiceth
For thou wilt not leave my soul in hell; neither wilt thou suffer thine Holy One to see corruption.
Thou wilt shew me the path of life
