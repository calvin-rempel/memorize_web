The fool hath said in his heart, There is no God. Corrupt are they, and have done abominable iniquity
God looked down from heaven upon the children of men, to see if there were any that did understand, that did seek God.
Every one of them is gone back
Have the workers of iniquity no knowledge? who eat up my people as they eat bread
There were they in great fear, where no fear was
Oh that the salvation of Israel were come out of Zion! When God bringeth back the captivity of his people, Jacob shall rejoice, and Israel shall be glad.
