Praise ye the LORD
The LORD doth build up Jerusalem
He healeth the broken in heart, and bindeth up their wounds.
He telleth the number of the stars; he calleth them all by their names.
Great is our Lord, and of great power
The LORD lifteth up the meek
Sing unto the LORD with thanksgiving; sing praise upon the harp unto our God
Who covereth the heaven with clouds, who prepareth rain for the earth, who maketh grass to grow upon the mountains.
He giveth to the beast his food, and to the young ravens which cry.
He delighteth not in the strength of the horse
The LORD taketh pleasure in them that fear him, in those that hope in his mercy.
Praise the LORD, O Jerusalem; praise thy God, O Zion.
For he hath strengthened the bars of thy gates; he hath blessed thy children within thee.
He maketh peace in thy borders, and filleth thee with the finest of the wheat.
He sendeth forth his commandment upon earth
He giveth snow like wool
He casteth forth his ice like morsels
He sendeth out his word, and melteth them
He sheweth his word unto Jacob, his statutes and his judgments unto Israel.
He hath not dealt so with any nation
