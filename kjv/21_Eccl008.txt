Who is as the wise man? and who knoweth the interpretation of a thing? a man's wisdom maketh his face to shine, and the boldness of his face shall be changed.
I counsel thee to keep the king's commandment, and that in regard of the oath of God.
Be not hasty to go out of his sight
Where the word of a king is, there is power
Whoso keepeth the commandment shall feel no evil thing
Because to every purpose there is time and judgment, therefore the misery of man is great upon him.
For he knoweth not that which shall be
There is no man that hath power over the spirit to retain the spirit; neither hath he power in the day of death
All this have I seen, and applied my heart unto every work that is done under the sun
And so I saw the wicked buried, who had come and gone from the place of the holy, and they were forgotten in the city where they had so done
Because sentence against an evil work is not executed speedily, therefore the heart of the sons of men is fully set in them to do evil.
Though a sinner do evil an hundred times, and his days be prolonged, yet surely I know that it shall be well with them that fear God, which fear before him
But it shall not be well with the wicked, neither shall he prolong his days, which are as a shadow; because he feareth not before God.
There is a vanity which is done upon the earth; that there be just men, unto whom it happeneth according to the work of the wicked; again, there be wicked men, to whom it happeneth according to the work of the righteous
Then I commended mirth, because a man hath no better thing under the sun, than to eat, and to drink, and to be merry
When I applied mine heart to know wisdom, and to see the business that is done upon the earth
Then I beheld all the work of God, that a man cannot find out the work that is done under the sun
