The proverbs of Solomon. A wise son maketh a glad father
Treasures of wickedness profit nothing
The LORD will not suffer the soul of the righteous to famish
He becometh poor that dealeth with a slack hand
He that gathereth in summer is a wise son
Blessings are upon the head of the just
The memory of the just is blessed
The wise in heart will receive commandments
He that walketh uprightly walketh surely
He that winketh with the eye causeth sorrow
The mouth of a righteous man is a well of life
Hatred stirreth up strifes
In the lips of him that hath understanding wisdom is found
Wise men lay up knowledge
The rich man's wealth is his strong city
The labour of the righteous tendeth to life
He is in the way of life that keepeth instruction
He that hideth hatred with lying lips, and he that uttereth a slander, is a fool.
In the multitude of words there wanteth not sin
The tongue of the just is as choice silver
The lips of the righteous feed many
The blessing of the LORD, it maketh rich, and he addeth no sorrow with it.
It is as sport to a fool to do mischief
The fear of the wicked, it shall come upon him
As the whirlwind passeth, so is the wicked no more
As vinegar to the teeth, and as smoke to the eyes, so is the sluggard to them that send him.
The fear of the LORD prolongeth days
The hope of the righteous shall be gladness
The way of the LORD is strength to the upright
The righteous shall never be removed
The mouth of the just bringeth forth wisdom
The lips of the righteous know what is acceptable
