Israel is an empty vine, he bringeth forth fruit unto himself
Their heart is divided; now shall they be found faulty
For now they shall say, We have no king, because we feared not the LORD; what then should a king do to us?
They have spoken words, swearing falsely in making a covenant
The inhabitants of Samaria shall fear because of the calves of Bethaven
It shall be also carried unto Assyria for a present to king Jareb
As for Samaria, her king is cut off as the foam upon the water.
The high places also of Aven, the sin of Israel, shall be destroyed
O Israel, thou hast sinned from the days of Gibeah
It is in my desire that I should chastise them; and the people shall be gathered against them, when they shall bind themselves in their two furrows.
And Ephraim is as an heifer that is taught, and loveth to tread out the corn; but I passed over upon her fair neck
Sow to yourselves in righteousness, reap in mercy; break up your fallow ground
Ye have plowed wickedness, ye have reaped iniquity; ye have eaten the fruit of lies
Therefore shall a tumult arise among thy people, and all thy fortresses shall be spoiled, as Shalman spoiled Betharbel in the day of battle
So shall Bethel do unto you because of your great wickedness
