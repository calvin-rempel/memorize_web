Hear my voice, O God, in my prayer
Hide me from the secret counsel of the wicked; from the insurrection of the workers of iniquity
Who whet their tongue like a sword, and bend their bows to shoot their arrows, even bitter words
That they may shoot in secret at the perfect
They encourage themselves in an evil matter
They search out iniquities; they accomplish a diligent search
But God shall shoot at them with an arrow; suddenly shall they be wounded.
So they shall make their own tongue to fall upon themselves
And all men shall fear, and shall declare the work of God; for they shall wisely consider of his doing.
The righteous shall be glad in the LORD, and shall trust in him; and all the upright in heart shall glory.
