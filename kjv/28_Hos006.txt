Come, and let us return unto the LORD
After two days will he revive us
Then shall we know, if we follow on to know the LORD
O Ephraim, what shall I do unto thee? O Judah, what shall I do unto thee? for your goodness is as a morning cloud, and as the early dew it goeth away.
Therefore have I hewed them by the prophets; I have slain them by the words of my mouth
For I desired mercy, and not sacrifice; and the knowledge of God more than burnt offerings.
But they like men have transgressed the covenant
Gilead is a city of them that work iniquity, and is polluted with blood.
And as troops of robbers wait for a man, so the company of priests murder in the way by consent
I have seen an horrible thing in the house of Israel
Also, O Judah, he hath set an harvest for thee, when I returned the captivity of my people.
