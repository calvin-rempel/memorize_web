I will praise thee with my whole heart
I will worship toward thy holy temple, and praise thy name for thy lovingkindness and for thy truth
In the day when I cried thou answeredst me, and strengthenedst me with strength in my soul.
All the kings of the earth shall praise thee, O LORD, when they hear the words of thy mouth.
Yea, they shall sing in the ways of the LORD
Though the LORD be high, yet hath he respect unto the lowly
Though I walk in the midst of trouble, thou wilt revive me
The LORD will perfect that which concerneth me
