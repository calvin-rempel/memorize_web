Save me, O God, by thy name, and judge me by thy strength.
Hear my prayer, O God; give ear to the words of my mouth.
For strangers are risen up against me, and oppressors seek after my soul
Behold, God is mine helper
He shall reward evil unto mine enemies
I will freely sacrifice unto thee
For he hath delivered me out of all trouble
