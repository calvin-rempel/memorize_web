How doth the city sit solitary, that was full of people! how is she become as a widow! she that was great among the nations, and princess among the provinces, how is she become tributary!
She weepeth sore in the night, and her tears are on her cheeks
Judah is gone into captivity because of affliction, and because of great servitude
The ways of Zion do mourn, because none come to the solemn feasts
Her adversaries are the chief, her enemies prosper; for the LORD hath afflicted her for the multitude of her transgressions
And from the daughter of Zion all her beauty is departed
Jerusalem remembered in the days of her affliction and of her miseries all her pleasant things that she had in the days of old, when her people fell into the hand of the enemy, and none did help her
Jerusalem hath grievously sinned; therefore she is removed
Her filthiness is in her skirts; she remembereth not her last end; therefore she came down wonderfully
The adversary hath spread out his hand upon all her pleasant things
All her people sigh, they seek bread; they have given their pleasant things for meat to relieve the soul
Is it nothing to you, all ye that pass by? behold, and see if there be any sorrow like unto my sorrow, which is done unto me, wherewith the LORD hath afflicted me in the day of his fierce anger.
From above hath he sent fire into my bones, and it prevaileth against them
The yoke of my transgressions is bound by his hand
The LORD hath trodden under foot all my mighty men in the midst of me
For these things I weep; mine eye, mine eye runneth down with water, because the comforter that should relieve my soul is far from me
Zion spreadeth forth her hands, and there is none to comfort her
The LORD is righteous; for I have rebelled against his commandment
I called for my lovers, but they deceived me
Behold, O LORD; for I am in distress
They have heard that I sigh
Let all their wickedness come before thee; and do unto them, as thou hast done unto me for all my transgressions
