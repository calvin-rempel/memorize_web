By night on my bed I sought him whom my soul loveth
I will rise now, and go about the city in the streets, and in the broad ways I will seek him whom my soul loveth
The watchmen that go about the city found me
It was but a little that I passed from them, but I found him whom my soul loveth
I charge you, O ye daughters of Jerusalem, by the roes, and by the hinds of the field, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, till he please.

King Solomon made himself a chariot of the wood of Lebanon.
He made the pillars thereof of silver, the bottom thereof of gold, the covering of it of purple, the midst thereof being paved with love, for the daughters of Jerusalem.
Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart.
