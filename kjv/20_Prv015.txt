A soft answer turneth away wrath
The tongue of the wise useth knowledge aright
The eyes of the LORD are in every place, beholding the evil and the good.
A wholesome tongue is a tree of life
A fool despiseth his father's instruction
In the house of the righteous is much treasure
The lips of the wise disperse knowledge
The sacrifice of the wicked is an abomination to the LORD
The way of the wicked is an abomination unto the LORD
Correction is grievous unto him that forsaketh the way
Hell and destruction are before the LORD
A scorner loveth not one that reproveth him
A merry heart maketh a cheerful countenance
The heart of him that hath understanding seeketh knowledge
All the days of the afflicted are evil
Better is little with the fear of the LORD than great treasure and trouble therewith.
Better is a dinner of herbs where love is, than a stalled ox and hatred therewith.
A wrathful man stirreth up strife
The way of the slothful man is as an hedge of thorns
A wise son maketh a glad father
Folly is joy to him that is destitute of wisdom
Without counsel purposes are disappointed
A man hath joy by the answer of his mouth
The way of life is above to the wise, that he may depart from hell beneath.
The LORD will destroy the house of the proud
The thoughts of the wicked are an abomination to the LORD
He that is greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that hateth gifts shall live.
The heart of the righteous studieth to answer
The LORD is far from the wicked
The light of the eyes rejoiceth the heart
The ear that heareth the reproof of life abideth among the wise.
He that refuseth instruction despiseth his own soul
The fear of the LORD is the instruction of wisdom; and before honour is humility.
