Wisdom hath builded her house, she hath hewn out her seven pillars
She hath killed her beasts; she hath mingled her wine; she hath also furnished her table.
She hath sent forth her maidens
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither
Come, eat of my bread, and drink of the wine which I have mingled.
Forsake the foolish, and live; and go in the way of understanding.
He that reproveth a scorner getteth to himself shame
Reprove not a scorner, lest he hate thee
Give instruction to a wise man, and he will be yet wiser
The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom
For by me thy days shall be multiplied, and the years of thy life shall be increased.
If thou be wise, thou shalt be wise for thyself
A foolish woman is clamorous
For she sitteth at the door of her house, on a seat in the high places of the city,
To call passengers who go right on their ways
Whoso is simple, let him turn in hither
Stolen waters are sweet, and bread eaten in secret is pleasant.
But he knoweth not that the dead are there; and that her guests are in the depths of hell.
