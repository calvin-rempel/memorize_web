How is the gold become dim! how is the most fine gold changed! the stones of the sanctuary are poured out in the top of every street.
The precious sons of Zion, comparable to fine gold, how are they esteemed as earthen pitchers, the work of the hands of the potter!
Even the sea monsters draw out the breast, they give suck to their young ones
The tongue of the sucking child cleaveth to the roof of his mouth for thirst
They that did feed delicately are desolate in the streets
For the punishment of the iniquity of the daughter of my people is greater than the punishment of the sin of Sodom, that was overthrown as in a moment, and no hands stayed on her.
Her Nazarites were purer than snow, they were whiter than milk, they were more ruddy in body than rubies, their polishing was of sapphire
Their visage is blacker than a coal; they are not known in the streets
They that be slain with the sword are better than they that be slain with hunger
The hands of the pitiful women have sodden their own children
The LORD hath accomplished his fury; he hath poured out his fierce anger, and hath kindled a fire in Zion, and it hath devoured the foundations thereof.
The kings of the earth, and all the inhabitants of the world, would not have believed that the adversary and the enemy should have entered into the gates of Jerusalem.
For the sins of her prophets, and the iniquities of her priests, that have shed the blood of the just in the midst of her,
They have wandered as blind men in the streets, they have polluted themselves with blood, so that men could not touch their garments.
They cried unto them, Depart ye; it is unclean; depart, depart, touch not
The anger of the LORD hath divided them; he will no more regard them
As for us, our eyes as yet failed for our vain help
They hunt our steps, that we cannot go in our streets
Our persecutors are swifter than the eagles of the heaven
The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the LORD, was taken in their pits, of whom we said, Under his shadow we shall live among the heathen.
Rejoice and be glad, O daughter of Edom, that dwellest in the land of Uz; the cup also shall pass through unto thee
The punishment of thine iniquity is accomplished, O daughter of Zion; he will no more carry thee away into captivity
