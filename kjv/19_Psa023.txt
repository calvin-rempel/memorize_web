The LORD is my shepherd; I shall not want.
He maketh me to lie down in green pastures
He restoreth my soul
Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil
Thou preparest a table before me in the presence of mine enemies
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life
