Give ear to my words, O LORD, consider my meditation.
Hearken unto the voice of my cry, my King, and my God
My voice shalt thou hear in the morning, O LORD; in the morning will I direct my prayer unto thee, and will look up.
For thou art not a God that hath pleasure in wickedness
The foolish shall not stand in thy sight
Thou shalt destroy them that speak leasing
But as for me, I will come into thy house in the multitude of thy mercy
Lead me, O LORD, in thy righteousness because of mine enemies; make thy way straight before my face.
For there is no faithfulness in their mouth; their inward part is very wickedness; their throat is an open sepulchre; they flatter with their tongue.
Destroy thou them, O God; let them fall by their own counsels; cast them out in the multitude of their transgressions; for they have rebelled against thee.
But let all those that put their trust in thee rejoice
For thou, LORD, wilt bless the righteous; with favour wilt thou compass him as with a shield.
