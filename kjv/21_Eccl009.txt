For all this I considered in my heart even to declare all this, that the righteous, and the wise, and their works, are in the hand of God
All things come alike to all
This is an evil among all things that are done under the sun, that there is one event unto all
For to him that is joined to all the living there is hope
For the living know that they shall die
Also their love, and their hatred, and their envy, is now perished; neither have they any more a portion for ever in any thing that is done under the sun.
Go thy way, eat thy bread with joy, and drink thy wine with a merry heart; for God now accepteth thy works.
Let thy garments be always white; and let thy head lack no ointment.
Live joyfully with the wife whom thou lovest all the days of the life of thy vanity, which he hath given thee under the sun, all the days of thy vanity
Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest.
I returned, and saw under the sun, that the race is not to the swift, nor the battle to the strong, neither yet bread to the wise, nor yet riches to men of understanding, nor yet favour to men of skill; but time and chance happeneth to them all.
For man also knoweth not his time
This wisdom have I seen also under the sun, and it seemed great unto me
There was a little city, and few men within it; and there came a great king against it, and besieged it, and built great bulwarks against it
Now there was found in it a poor wise man, and he by his wisdom delivered the city; yet no man remembered that same poor man.
Then said I, Wisdom is better than strength
The words of wise men are heard in quiet more than the cry of him that ruleth among fools.
Wisdom is better than weapons of war
