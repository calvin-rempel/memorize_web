In those days was Hezekiah sick unto death. And Isaiah the prophet the son of Amoz came unto him, and said unto him, Thus saith the LORD, Set thine house in order
Then Hezekiah turned his face toward the wall, and prayed unto the LORD,
And said, Remember now, O LORD, I beseech thee, how I have walked before thee in truth and with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in thy sight. And Hezekiah wept sore.
Then came the word of the LORD to Isaiah, saying,
Go, and say to Hezekiah, Thus saith the LORD, the God of David thy father, I have heard thy prayer, I have seen thy tears
And I will deliver thee and this city out of the hand of the king of Assyria
And this shall be a sign unto thee from the LORD, that the LORD will do this thing that he hath spoken;
Behold, I will bring again the shadow of the degrees, which is gone down in the sun dial of Ahaz, ten degrees backward. So the sun returned ten degrees, by which degrees it was gone down.
The writing of Hezekiah king of Judah, when he had been sick, and was recovered of his sickness
I said in the cutting off of my days, I shall go to the gates of the grave
I said, I shall not see the LORD, even the LORD, in the land of the living
Mine age is departed, and is removed from me as a shepherd's tent
I reckoned till morning, that, as a lion, so will he break all my bones
Like a crane or a swallow, so did I chatter
What shall I say? he hath both spoken unto me, and himself hath done it
O LORD, by these things men live, and in all these things is the life of my spirit
Behold, for peace I had great bitterness
For the grave cannot praise thee, death can not celebrate thee
The living, the living, he shall praise thee, as I do this day
The LORD was ready to save me
For Isaiah had said, Let them take a lump of figs, and lay it for a plaister upon the boil, and he shall recover.
Hezekiah also had said, What is the sign that I shall go up to the house of the LORD?
