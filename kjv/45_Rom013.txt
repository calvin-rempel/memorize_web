Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers. For there is no power but of God
Whosoever therefore resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God
For rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. Wilt thou then not be afraid of the power? do that which is good, and thou shalt have praise of the same
For he is the minister of God to thee for good. But if thou do that which is evil, be afraid; for he beareth not the sword in vain
Wherefore ye must needs be subject, not only for wrath, but also for conscience sake.
For for this cause pay ye tribute also
Render therefore to all their dues
Owe no man any thing, but to love one another
For this, Thou shalt not commit adultery, Thou shalt not kill, Thou shalt not steal, Thou shalt not bear false witness, Thou shalt not covet; and if there be any other commandment, it is briefly comprehended in this saying, namely, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour
And that, knowing the time, that now it is high time to awake out of sleep
The night is far spent, the day is at hand
Let us walk honestly, as in the day; not in rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness, not in strife and envying.
But put ye on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof.
