When Israel was a child, then I loved him, and called my son out of Egypt.
As they called them, so they went from them
I taught Ephraim also to go, taking them by their arms; but they knew not that I healed them.
I drew them with cords of a man, with bands of love
He shall not return into the land of Egypt, but the Assyrian shall be his king, because they refused to return.
And the sword shall abide on his cities, and shall consume his branches, and devour them, because of their own counsels.
And my people are bent to backsliding from me
How shall I give thee up, Ephraim? how shall I deliver thee, Israel? how shall I make thee as Admah? how shall I set thee as Zeboim? mine heart is turned within me, my repentings are kindled together.
I will not execute the fierceness of mine anger, I will not return to destroy Ephraim
They shall walk after the LORD
They shall tremble as a bird out of Egypt, and as a dove out of the land of Assyria
Ephraim compasseth me about with lies, and the house of Israel with deceit
