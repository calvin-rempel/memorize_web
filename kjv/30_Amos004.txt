Hear this word, ye kine of Bashan, that are in the mountain of Samaria, which oppress the poor, which crush the needy, which say to their masters, Bring, and let us drink.
The Lord GOD hath sworn by his holiness, that, lo, the days shall come upon you, that he will take you away with hooks, and your posterity with fishhooks.
And ye shall go out at the breaches, every cow at that which is before her; and ye shall cast them into the palace, saith the LORD.
Come to Bethel, and transgress; at Gilgal multiply transgression; and bring your sacrifices every morning, and your tithes after three years
And offer a sacrifice of thanksgiving with leaven, and proclaim and publish the free offerings
And I also have given you cleanness of teeth in all your cities, and want of bread in all your places
And also I have withholden the rain from you, when there were yet three months to the harvest
So two or three cities wandered unto one city, to drink water; but they were not satisfied
I have smitten you with blasting and mildew
I have sent among you the pestilence after the manner of Egypt
I have overthrown some of you, as God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah, and ye were as a firebrand plucked out of the burning
Therefore thus will I do unto thee, O Israel
For, lo, he that formeth the mountains, and createth the wind, and declareth unto man what is his thought, that maketh the morning darkness, and treadeth upon the high places of the earth, The LORD, The God of hosts, is his name.
