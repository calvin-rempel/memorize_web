Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth, may Israel now say
Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth
The plowers plowed upon my back
The LORD is righteous
Let them all be confounded and turned back that hate Zion.
Let them be as the grass upon the housetops, which withereth afore it groweth up
Wherewith the mower filleth not his hand; nor he that bindeth sheaves his bosom.
Neither do they which go by say, The blessing of the LORD be upon you
