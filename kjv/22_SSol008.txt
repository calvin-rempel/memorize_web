O that thou wert as my brother, that sucked the breasts of my mother! when I should find thee without, I would kiss thee; yea, I should not be despised.
I would lead thee, and bring thee into my mother's house, who would instruct me
His left hand should be under my head, and his right hand should embrace me.
I charge you, O daughters of Jerusalem, that ye stir not up, nor awake my love, until he please.
Who is this that cometh up from the wilderness, leaning upon her beloved? I raised thee up under the apple tree
Set me as a seal upon thine heart, as a seal upon thine arm
Many waters cannot quench love, neither can the floods drown it
We have a little sister, and she hath no breasts
If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver
I am a wall, and my breasts like towers
Solomon had a vineyard at Baalhamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.
My vineyard, which is mine, is before me
Thou that dwellest in the gardens, the companions hearken to thy voice
Make haste, my beloved, and be thou like to a roe or to a young hart upon the mountains of spices.
