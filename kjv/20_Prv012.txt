Whoso loveth instruction loveth knowledge
A good man obtaineth favour of the LORD
A man shall not be established by wickedness
A virtuous woman is a crown to her husband
The thoughts of the righteous are right
The words of the wicked are to lie in wait for blood
The wicked are overthrown, and are not
A man shall be commended according to his wisdom
He that is despised, and hath a servant, is better than he that honoureth himself, and lacketh bread.
A righteous man regardeth the life of his beast
He that tilleth his land shall be satisfied with bread
The wicked desireth the net of evil men
The wicked is snared by the transgression of his lips
A man shall be satisfied with good by the fruit of his mouth
The way of a fool is right in his own eyes
A fool's wrath is presently known
He that speaketh truth sheweth forth righteousness
There is that speaketh like the piercings of a sword
The lip of truth shall be established for ever
Deceit is in the heart of them that imagine evil
There shall no evil happen to the just
Lying lips are abomination to the LORD
A prudent man concealeth knowledge
The hand of the diligent shall bear rule
Heaviness in the heart of man maketh it stoop
The righteous is more excellent than his neighbour
The slothful man roasteth not that which he took in hunting
In the way of righteousness is life
