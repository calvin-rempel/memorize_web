Hold not thy peace, O God of my praise;
For the mouth of the wicked and the mouth of the deceitful are opened against me
They compassed me about also with words of hatred; and fought against me without a cause.
For my love they are my adversaries
And they have rewarded me evil for good, and hatred for my love.
Set thou a wicked man over him
When he shall be judged, let him be condemned
Let his days be few; and let another take his office.
Let his children be fatherless, and his wife a widow.
Let his children be continually vagabonds, and beg
Let the extortioner catch all that he hath; and let the strangers spoil his labour.
Let there be none to extend mercy unto him
Let his posterity be cut off; and in the generation following let their name be blotted out.
Let the iniquity of his fathers be remembered with the LORD; and let not the sin of his mother be blotted out.
Let them be before the LORD continually, that he may cut off the memory of them from the earth.
Because that he remembered not to shew mercy, but persecuted the poor and needy man, that he might even slay the broken in heart.
As he loved cursing, so let it come unto him
As he clothed himself with cursing like as with his garment, so let it come into his bowels like water, and like oil into his bones.
Let it be unto him as the garment which covereth him, and for a girdle wherewith he is girded continually.
Let this be the reward of mine adversaries from the LORD, and of them that speak evil against my soul.
But do thou for me, O GOD the Lord, for thy name's sake
For I am poor and needy, and my heart is wounded within me.
I am gone like the shadow when it declineth
My knees are weak through fasting; and my flesh faileth of fatness.
I became also a reproach unto them
Help me, O LORD my God
That they may know that this is thy hand; that thou, LORD, hast done it.
Let them curse, but bless thou
Let mine adversaries be clothed with shame, and let them cover themselves with their own confusion, as with a mantle.
I will greatly praise the LORD with my mouth; yea, I will praise him among the multitude.
For he shall stand at the right hand of the poor, to save him from those that condemn his soul.
