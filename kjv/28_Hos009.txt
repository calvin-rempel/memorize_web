Rejoice not, O Israel, for joy, as other people
The floor and the winepress shall not feed them, and the new wine shall fail in her.
They shall not dwell in the LORD's land; but Ephraim shall return to Egypt, and they shall eat unclean things in Assyria.
They shall not offer wine offerings to the LORD, neither shall they be pleasing unto him
What will ye do in the solemn day, and in the day of the feast of the LORD?
For, lo, they are gone because of destruction
The days of visitation are come, the days of recompence are come; Israel shall know it
The watchman of Ephraim was with my God
They have deeply corrupted themselves, as in the days of Gibeah
I found Israel like grapes in the wilderness; I saw your fathers as the firstripe in the fig tree at her first time
As for Ephraim, their glory shall fly away like a bird, from the birth, and from the womb, and from the conception.
Though they bring up their children, yet will I bereave them, that there shall not be a man left
Ephraim, as I saw Tyrus, is planted in a pleasant place
Give them, O LORD
All their wickedness is in Gilgal
Ephraim is smitten, their root is dried up, they shall bear no fruit
My God will cast them away, because they did not hearken unto him
