Deliver me from mine enemies, O my God
Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, and save me from bloody men.
For, lo, they lie in wait for my soul
They run and prepare themselves without my fault
Thou therefore, O LORD God of hosts, the God of Israel, awake to visit all the heathen
They return at evening
Behold, they belch out with their mouth
But thou, O LORD, shalt laugh at them; thou shalt have all the heathen in derision.
Because of his strength will I wait upon thee
The God of my mercy shall prevent me
Slay them not, lest my people forget
For the sin of their mouth and the words of their lips let them even be taken in their pride
Consume them in wrath, consume them, that they may not be
And at evening let them return; and let them make a noise like a dog, and go round about the city.
Let them wander up and down for meat, and grudge if they be not satisfied.
But I will sing of thy power; yea, I will sing aloud of thy mercy in the morning
Unto thee, O my strength, will I sing
