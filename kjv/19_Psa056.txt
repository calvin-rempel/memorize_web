Be merciful unto me, O God
Mine enemies would daily swallow me up
What time I am afraid, I will trust in thee.
In God I will praise his word, in God I have put my trust; I will not fear what flesh can do unto me.
Every day they wrest my words
They gather themselves together, they hide themselves, they mark my steps, when they wait for my soul.
Shall they escape by iniquity? in thine anger cast down the people, O God.
Thou tellest my wanderings
When I cry unto thee, then shall mine enemies turn back
In God will I praise his word
In God have I put my trust
Thy vows are upon me, O God
For thou hast delivered my soul from death
