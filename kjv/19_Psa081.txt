Sing aloud unto God our strength
Take a psalm, and bring hither the timbrel, the pleasant harp with the psaltery.
Blow up the trumpet in the new moon, in the time appointed, on our solemn feast day.
For this was a statute for Israel, and a law of the God of Jacob.
This he ordained in Joseph for a testimony, when he went out through the land of Egypt
I removed his shoulder from the burden
Thou calledst in trouble, and I delivered thee; I answered thee in the secret place of thunder
Hear, O my people, and I will testify unto thee
There shall no strange god be in thee; neither shalt thou worship any strange god.
I am the LORD thy God, which brought thee out of the land of Egypt
But my people would not hearken to my voice; and Israel would none of me.
So I gave them up unto their own hearts' lust
Oh that my people had hearkened unto me, and Israel had walked in my ways!
I should soon have subdued their enemies, and turned my hand against their adversaries.
The haters of the LORD should have submitted themselves unto him
He should have fed them also with the finest of the wheat
