The king shall joy in thy strength, O LORD; and in thy salvation how greatly shall he rejoice!
Thou hast given him his heart's desire, and hast not withholden the request of his lips. Selah.
For thou preventest him with the blessings of goodness
He asked life of thee, and thou gavest it him, even length of days for ever and ever.
His glory is great in thy salvation
For thou hast made him most blessed for ever
For the king trusteth in the LORD, and through the mercy of the most High he shall not be moved.
Thine hand shall find out all thine enemies
Thou shalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger
Their fruit shalt thou destroy from the earth, and their seed from among the children of men.
For they intended evil against thee
Therefore shalt thou make them turn their back, when thou shalt make ready thine arrows upon thy strings against the face of them.
Be thou exalted, LORD, in thine own strength
