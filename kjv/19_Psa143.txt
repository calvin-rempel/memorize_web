Hear my prayer, O LORD, give ear to my supplications
And enter not into judgment with thy servant
For the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath smitten my life down to the ground; he hath made me to dwell in darkness, as those that have been long dead.
Therefore is my spirit overwhelmed within me; my heart within me is desolate.
I remember the days of old; I meditate on all thy works; I muse on the work of thy hands.
I stretch forth my hands unto thee
Hear me speedily, O LORD
Cause me to hear thy lovingkindness in the morning; for in thee do I trust
Deliver me, O LORD, from mine enemies
Teach me to do thy will; for thou art my God
Quicken me, O LORD, for thy name's sake
And of thy mercy cut off mine enemies, and destroy all them that afflict my soul
