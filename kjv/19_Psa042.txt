As the hart panteth after the water brooks, so panteth my soul after thee, O God.
My soul thirsteth for God, for the living God
My tears have been my meat day and night, while they continually say unto me, Where is thy God?
When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted in me? hope thou in God
O my God, my soul is cast down within me
Deep calleth unto deep at the noise of thy waterspouts
Yet the LORD will command his lovingkindness in the day time, and in the night his song shall be with me, and my prayer unto the God of my life.
I will say unto God my rock, Why hast thou forgotten me? why go I mourning because of the oppression of the enemy?
As with a sword in my bones, mine enemies reproach me; while they say daily unto me, Where is thy God?
Why art thou cast down, O my soul? and why art thou disquieted within me? hope thou in God
