My God, my God, why hast thou forsaken me? why art thou so far from helping me, and from the words of my roaring?
O my God, I cry in the day time, but thou hearest not; and in the night season, and am not silent.
But thou art holy, O thou that inhabitest the praises of Israel.
Our fathers trusted in thee
They cried unto thee, and were delivered
But I am a worm, and no man; a reproach of men, and despised of the people.
All they that see me laugh me to scorn
He trusted on the LORD that he would deliver him
But thou art he that took me out of the womb
I was cast upon thee from the womb
Be not far from me; for trouble is near; for there is none to help.
Many bulls have compassed me
They gaped upon me with their mouths, as a ravening and a roaring lion.
I am poured out like water, and all my bones are out of joint
My strength is dried up like a potsherd; and my tongue cleaveth to my jaws; and thou hast brought me into the dust of death.
For dogs have compassed me
I may tell all my bones
They part my garments among them, and cast lots upon my vesture.
But be not thou far from me, O LORD
Deliver my soul from the sword; my darling from the power of the dog.
Save me from the lion's mouth
I will declare thy name unto my brethren
Ye that fear the LORD, praise him; all ye the seed of Jacob, glorify him; and fear him, all ye the seed of Israel.
For he hath not despised nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither hath he hid his face from him; but when he cried unto him, he heard.
My praise shall be of thee in the great congregation
The meek shall eat and be satisfied
All the ends of the world shall remember and turn unto the LORD
For the kingdom is the LORD's
All they that be fat upon earth shall eat and worship
A seed shall serve him; it shall be accounted to the Lord for a generation.
They shall come, and shall declare his righteousness unto a people that shall be born, that he hath done this.
