A false balance is abomination to the LORD
When pride cometh, then cometh shame
The integrity of the upright shall guide them
Riches profit not in the day of wrath
The righteousness of the perfect shall direct his way
The righteousness of the upright shall deliver them
When a wicked man dieth, his expectation shall perish
The righteous is delivered out of trouble, and the wicked cometh in his stead.
An hypocrite with his mouth destroyeth his neighbour
When it goeth well with the righteous, the city rejoiceth
By the blessing of the upright the city is exalted
He that is void of wisdom despiseth his neighbour
A talebearer revealeth secrets
Where no counsel is, the people fall
He that is surety for a stranger shall smart for it
A gracious woman retaineth honour
The merciful man doeth good to his own soul
The wicked worketh a deceitful work
As righteousness tendeth to life
They that are of a froward heart are abomination to the LORD
Though hand join in hand, the wicked shall not be unpunished
As a jewel of gold in a swine's snout, so is a fair woman which is without discretion.
The desire of the righteous is only good
There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth; and there is that withholdeth more than is meet, but it tendeth to poverty.
The liberal soul shall be made fat
He that withholdeth corn, the people shall curse him
He that diligently seeketh good procureth favour
He that trusteth in his riches shall fall; but the righteous shall flourish as a branch.
He that troubleth his own house shall inherit the wind
The fruit of the righteous is a tree of life; and he that winneth souls is wise.
Behold, the righteous shall be recompensed in the earth
