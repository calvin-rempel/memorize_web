I cried unto God with my voice, even unto God with my voice; and he gave ear unto me.
In the day of my trouble I sought the Lord
I remembered God, and was troubled
Thou holdest mine eyes waking
I have considered the days of old, the years of ancient times.
I call to remembrance my song in the night
Will the Lord cast off for ever? and will he be favourable no more?
Is his mercy clean gone for ever? doth his promise fail for evermore?
Hath God forgotten to be gracious? hath he in anger shut up his tender mercies? Selah.
And I said, This is my infirmity
I will remember the works of the LORD
I will meditate also of all thy work, and talk of thy doings.
Thy way, O God, is in the sanctuary
Thou art the God that doest wonders
Thou hast with thine arm redeemed thy people, the sons of Jacob and Joseph. Selah.
The waters saw thee, O God, the waters saw thee; they were afraid
The clouds poured out water
The voice of thy thunder was in the heaven
Thy way is in the sea, and thy path in the great waters, and thy footsteps are not known.
Thou leddest thy people like a flock by the hand of Moses and Aaron.
