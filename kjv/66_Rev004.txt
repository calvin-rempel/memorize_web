After this I looked, and, behold, a door was opened in heaven
And immediately I was in the spirit
And he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone
And round about the throne were four and twenty seats
And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices
And before the throne there was a sea of glass like unto crystal
And the first beast was like a lion, and the second beast like a calf, and the third beast had a face as a man, and the fourth beast was like a flying eagle.
And the four beasts had each of them six wings about him; and they were full of eyes within
And when those beasts give glory and honour and thanks to him that sat on the throne, who liveth for ever and ever,
The four and twenty elders fall down before him that sat on the throne, and worship him that liveth for ever and ever, and cast their crowns before the throne, saying,
Thou art worthy, O Lord, to receive glory and honour and power
