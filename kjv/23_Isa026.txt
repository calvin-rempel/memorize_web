In that day shall this song be sung in the land of Judah; We have a strong city; salvation will God appoint for walls and bulwarks.
Open ye the gates, that the righteous nation which keepeth the truth may enter in.
Thou wilt keep him in perfect peace, whose mind is stayed on thee
Trust ye in the LORD for ever
For he bringeth down them that dwell on high; the lofty city, he layeth it low; he layeth it low, even to the ground; he bringeth it even to the dust.
The foot shall tread it down, even the feet of the poor, and the steps of the needy.
The way of the just is uprightness
Yea, in the way of thy judgments, O LORD, have we waited for thee; the desire of our soul is to thy name, and to the remembrance of thee.
With my soul have I desired thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek thee early
Let favour be shewed to the wicked, yet will he not learn righteousness
LORD, when thy hand is lifted up, they will not see
LORD, thou wilt ordain peace for us
O LORD our God, other lords beside thee have had dominion over us
They are dead, they shall not live; they are deceased, they shall not rise
Thou hast increased the nation, O LORD, thou hast increased the nation
LORD, in trouble have they visited thee, they poured out a prayer when thy chastening was upon them.
Like as a woman with child, that draweth near the time of her delivery, is in pain, and crieth out in her pangs; so have we been in thy sight, O LORD.
We have been with child, we have been in pain, we have as it were brought forth wind; we have not wrought any deliverance in the earth; neither have the inhabitants of the world fallen.
Thy dead men shall live, together with my dead body shall they arise. Awake and sing, ye that dwell in dust
Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and shut thy doors about thee
For, behold, the LORD cometh out of his place to punish the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity
