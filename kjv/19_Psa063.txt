O God, thou art my God; early will I seek thee
To see thy power and thy glory, so as I have seen thee in the sanctuary.
Because thy lovingkindness is better than life, my lips shall praise thee.
Thus will I bless thee while I live
My soul shall be satisfied as with marrow and fatness; and my mouth shall praise thee with joyful lips
When I remember thee upon my bed, and meditate on thee in the night watches.
Because thou hast been my help, therefore in the shadow of thy wings will I rejoice.
My soul followeth hard after thee
But those that seek my soul, to destroy it, shall go into the lower parts of the earth.
They shall fall by the sword
But the king shall rejoice in God; every one that sweareth by him shall glory
