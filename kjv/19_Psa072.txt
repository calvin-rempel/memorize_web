Give the king thy judgments, O God, and thy righteousness unto the king's son.
He shall judge thy people with righteousness, and thy poor with judgment.
The mountains shall bring peace to the people, and the little hills, by righteousness.
He shall judge the poor of the people, he shall save the children of the needy, and shall break in pieces the oppressor.
They shall fear thee as long as the sun and moon endure, throughout all generations.
He shall come down like rain upon the mown grass
In his days shall the righteous flourish; and abundance of peace so long as the moon endureth.
He shall have dominion also from sea to sea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth.
They that dwell in the wilderness shall bow before him; and his enemies shall lick the dust.
The kings of Tarshish and of the isles shall bring presents
Yea, all kings shall fall down before him
For he shall deliver the needy when he crieth; the poor also, and him that hath no helper.
He shall spare the poor and needy, and shall save the souls of the needy.
He shall redeem their soul from deceit and violence
And he shall live, and to him shall be given of the gold of Sheba
There shall be an handful of corn in the earth upon the top of the mountains; the fruit thereof shall shake like Lebanon
His name shall endure for ever
Blessed be the LORD God, the God of Israel, who only doeth wondrous things.
And blessed be his glorious name for ever
The prayers of David the son of Jesse are ended.
