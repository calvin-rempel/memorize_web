Blessed be the LORD my strength, which teacheth my hands to war, and my fingers to fight
My goodness, and my fortress; my high tower, and my deliverer; my shield, and he in whom I trust; who subdueth my people under me.
LORD, what is man, that thou takest knowledge of him! or the son of man, that thou makest account of him!
Man is like to vanity
Bow thy heavens, O LORD, and come down
Cast forth lightning, and scatter them
Send thine hand from above; rid me, and deliver me out of great waters, from the hand of strange children;
Whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood.
I will sing a new song unto thee, O God
It is he that giveth salvation unto kings
Rid me, and deliver me from the hand of strange children, whose mouth speaketh vanity, and their right hand is a right hand of falsehood
That our sons may be as plants grown up in their youth; that our daughters may be as corner stones, polished after the similitude of a palace
That our garners may be full, affording all manner of store
That our oxen may be strong to labour; that there be no breaking in, nor going out; that there be no complaining in our streets.
Happy is that people, that is in such a case
