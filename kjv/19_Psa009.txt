I will praise thee, O LORD, with my whole heart; I will shew forth all thy marvellous works.
I will be glad and rejoice in thee
When mine enemies are turned back, they shall fall and perish at thy presence.
For thou hast maintained my right and my cause; thou satest in the throne judging right.
Thou hast rebuked the heathen, thou hast destroyed the wicked, thou hast put out their name for ever and ever.
O thou enemy, destructions are come to a perpetual end
But the LORD shall endure for ever
And he shall judge the world in righteousness, he shall minister judgment to the people in uprightness.
The LORD also will be a refuge for the oppressed, a refuge in times of trouble.
And they that know thy name will put their trust in thee
Sing praises to the LORD, which dwelleth in Zion
When he maketh inquisition for blood, he remembereth them
Have mercy upon me, O LORD; consider my trouble which I suffer of them that hate me, thou that liftest me up from the gates of death
That I may shew forth all thy praise in the gates of the daughter of Zion
The heathen are sunk down in the pit that they made
The LORD is known by the judgment which he executeth
The wicked shall be turned into hell, and all the nations that forget God.
For the needy shall not alway be forgotten
Arise, O LORD; let not man prevail
Put them in fear, O LORD
