Set the trumpet to thy mouth. He shall come as an eagle against the house of the LORD, because they have transgressed my covenant, and trespassed against my law.
Israel shall cry unto me, My God, we know thee.
Israel hath cast off the thing that is good
They have set up kings, but not by me
Thy calf, O Samaria, hath cast thee off; mine anger is kindled against them
For from Israel was it also
For they have sown the wind, and they shall reap the whirlwind
Israel is swallowed up
For they are gone up to Assyria, a wild ass alone by himself
Yea, though they have hired among the nations, now will I gather them, and they shall sorrow a little for the burden of the king of princes.
Because Ephraim hath made many altars to sin, altars shall be unto him to sin.
I have written to him the great things of my law, but they were counted as a strange thing.
They sacrifice flesh for the sacrifices of mine offerings, and eat it; but the LORD accepteth them not; now will he remember their iniquity, and visit their sins
For Israel hath forgotten his Maker, and buildeth temples; and Judah hath multiplied fenced cities
