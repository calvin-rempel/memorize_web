Who hath believed our report? and to whom is the arm of the LORD revealed?
For he shall grow up before him as a tender plant, and as a root out of a dry ground
He is despised and rejected of men; a man of sorrows, and acquainted with grief
Surely he hath borne our griefs, and carried our sorrows
But he was wounded for our transgressions, he was bruised for our iniquities
All we like sheep have gone astray; we have turned every one to his own way; and the LORD hath laid on him the iniquity of us all.
He was oppressed, and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth
He was taken from prison and from judgment
And he made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich in his death; because he had done no violence, neither was any deceit in his mouth.
Yet it pleased the LORD to bruise him; he hath put him to grief
He shall see of the travail of his soul, and shall be satisfied
Therefore will I divide him a portion with the great, and he shall divide the spoil with the strong; because he hath poured out his soul unto death
