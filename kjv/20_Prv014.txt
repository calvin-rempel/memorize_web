Every wise woman buildeth her house
He that walketh in his uprightness feareth the LORD
In the mouth of the foolish is a rod of pride
Where no oxen are, the crib is clean
A faithful witness will not lie
A scorner seeketh wisdom, and findeth it not
Go from the presence of a foolish man, when thou perceivest not in him the lips of knowledge.
The wisdom of the prudent is to understand his way
Fools make a mock at sin
The heart knoweth his own bitterness; and a stranger doth not intermeddle with his joy.
The house of the wicked shall be overthrown
There is a way which seemeth right unto a man, but the end thereof are the ways of death.
Even in laughter the heart is sorrowful; and the end of that mirth is heaviness.
The backslider in heart shall be filled with his own ways
The simple believeth every word
A wise man feareth, and departeth from evil
He that is soon angry dealeth foolishly
The simple inherit folly
The evil bow before the good; and the wicked at the gates of the righteous.
The poor is hated even of his own neighbour
He that despiseth his neighbour sinneth
Do they not err that devise evil? but mercy and truth shall be to them that devise good.
In all labour there is profit
The crown of the wise is their riches
A true witness delivereth souls
In the fear of the LORD is strong confidence
The fear of the LORD is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.
In the multitude of people is the king's honour
He that is slow to wrath is of great understanding
A sound heart is the life of the flesh
He that oppresseth the poor reproacheth his Maker
The wicked is driven away in his wickedness
Wisdom resteth in the heart of him that hath understanding
Righteousness exalteth a nation
The king's favour is toward a wise servant
