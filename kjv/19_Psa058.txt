Do ye indeed speak righteousness, O congregation? do ye judge uprightly, O ye sons of men?
Yea, in heart ye work wickedness; ye weigh the violence of your hands in the earth.
The wicked are estranged from the womb
Their poison is like the poison of a serpent
Which will not hearken to the voice of charmers, charming never so wisely.
Break their teeth, O God, in their mouth
Let them melt away as waters which run continually
As a snail which melteth, let every one of them pass away
Before your pots can feel the thorns, he shall take them away as with a whirlwind, both living, and in his wrath.
The righteous shall rejoice when he seeth the vengeance
So that a man shall say, Verily there is a reward for the righteous
