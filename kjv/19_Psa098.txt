O sing unto the LORD a new song; for he hath done marvellous things
The LORD hath made known his salvation
He hath remembered his mercy and his truth toward the house of Israel
Make a joyful noise unto the LORD, all the earth
Sing unto the LORD with the harp; with the harp, and the voice of a psalm.
With trumpets and sound of cornet make a joyful noise before the LORD, the King.
Let the sea roar, and the fulness thereof; the world, and they that dwell therein.
Let the floods clap their hands
Before the LORD; for he cometh to judge the earth
