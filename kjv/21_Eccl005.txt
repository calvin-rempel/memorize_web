Keep thy foot when thou goest to the house of God, and be more ready to hear, than to give the sacrifice of fools
Be not rash with thy mouth, and let not thine heart be hasty to utter any thing before God
For a dream cometh through the multitude of business; and a fool's voice is known by multitude of words.
When thou vowest a vow unto God, defer not to pay it; for he hath no pleasure in fools
Better is it that thou shouldest not vow, than that thou shouldest vow and not pay.
Suffer not thy mouth to cause thy flesh to sin; neither say thou before the angel, that it was an error
For in the multitude of dreams and many words there are also divers vanities
If thou seest the oppression of the poor, and violent perverting of judgment and justice in a province, marvel not at the matter
Moreover the profit of the earth is for all
He that loveth silver shall not be satisfied with silver; nor he that loveth abundance with increase
When goods increase, they are increased that eat them
The sleep of a labouring man is sweet, whether he eat little or much
There is a sore evil which I have seen under the sun, namely, riches kept for the owners thereof to their hurt.
But those riches perish by evil travail
As he came forth of his mother's womb, naked shall he return to go as he came, and shall take nothing of his labour, which he may carry away in his hand.
And this also is a sore evil, that in all points as he came, so shall he go
All his days also he eateth in darkness, and he hath much sorrow and wrath with his sickness.
Behold that which I have seen
Every man also to whom God hath given riches and wealth, and hath given him power to eat thereof, and to take his portion, and to rejoice in his labour; this is the gift of God.
For he shall not much remember the days of his life; because God answereth him in the joy of his heart.
