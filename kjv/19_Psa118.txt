O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good
Let Israel now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let the house of Aaron now say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
Let them now that fear the LORD say, that his mercy endureth for ever.
I called upon the LORD in distress
The LORD is on my side; I will not fear
The LORD taketh my part with them that help me
It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in man.
It is better to trust in the LORD than to put confidence in princes.
All nations compassed me about
They compassed me about; yea, they compassed me about
They compassed me about like bees; they are quenched as the fire of thorns
Thou hast thrust sore at me that I might fall
The LORD is my strength and song, and is become my salvation.
The voice of rejoicing and salvation is in the tabernacles of the righteous
The right hand of the LORD is exalted
I shall not die, but live, and declare the works of the LORD.
The LORD hath chastened me sore
Open to me the gates of righteousness
This gate of the LORD, into which the righteous shall enter.
I will praise thee
The stone which the builders refused is become the head stone of the corner.
This is the LORD's doing; it is marvellous in our eyes.
This is the day which the LORD hath made; we will rejoice and be glad in it.
Save now, I beseech thee, O LORD
Blessed be he that cometh in the name of the LORD
God is the LORD, which hath shewed us light
Thou art my God, and I will praise thee
O give thanks unto the LORD; for he is good
