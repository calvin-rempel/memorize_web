He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy.
When the righteous are in authority, the people rejoice
Whoso loveth wisdom rejoiceth his father
The king by judgment establisheth the land
A man that flattereth his neighbour spreadeth a net for his feet.
In the transgression of an evil man there is a snare
The righteous considereth the cause of the poor
Scornful men bring a city into a snare
If a wise man contendeth with a foolish man, whether he rage or laugh, there is no rest.
The bloodthirsty hate the upright
A fool uttereth all his mind
If a ruler hearken to lies, all his servants are wicked.
The poor and the deceitful man meet together
The king that faithfully judgeth the poor, his throne shall be established for ever.
The rod and reproof give wisdom
When the wicked are multiplied, transgression increaseth
Correct thy son, and he shall give thee rest; yea, he shall give delight unto thy soul.
Where there is no vision, the people perish
A servant will not be corrected by words
Seest thou a man that is hasty in his words? there is more hope of a fool than of him.
He that delicately bringeth up his servant from a child shall have him become his son at the length.
An angry man stirreth up strife, and a furious man aboundeth in transgression.
A man's pride shall bring him low
Whoso is partner with a thief hateth his own soul
The fear of man bringeth a snare
Many seek the ruler's favour; but every man's judgment cometh from the LORD.
An unjust man is an abomination to the just
