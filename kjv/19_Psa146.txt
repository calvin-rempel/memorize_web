Praise ye the LORD. Praise the LORD, O my soul.
While I live will I praise the LORD
Put not your trust in princes, nor in the son of man, in whom there is no help.
His breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts perish.
Happy is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whose hope is in the LORD his God
Which made heaven, and earth, the sea, and all that therein is
Which executeth judgment for the oppressed
The LORD openeth the eyes of the blind
The LORD preserveth the strangers; he relieveth the fatherless and widow
The LORD shall reign for ever, even thy God, O Zion, unto all generations. Praise ye the LORD.
