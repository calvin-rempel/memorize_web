When I would have healed Israel, then the iniquity of Ephraim was discovered, and the wickedness of Samaria
And they consider not in their hearts that I remember all their wickedness
They make the king glad with their wickedness, and the princes with their lies.
They are all adulterers, as an oven heated by the baker, who ceaseth from raising after he hath kneaded the dough, until it be leavened.
In the day of our king the princes have made him sick with bottles of wine; he stretched out his hand with scorners.
For they have made ready their heart like an oven, whiles they lie in wait
They are all hot as an oven, and have devoured their judges; all their kings are fallen
Ephraim, he hath mixed himself among the people; Ephraim is a cake not turned.
Strangers have devoured his strength, and he knoweth it not
And the pride of Israel testifieth to his face
Ephraim also is like a silly dove without heart
When they shall go, I will spread my net upon them; I will bring them down as the fowls of the heaven; I will chastise them, as their congregation hath heard.
Woe unto them! for they have fled from me
And they have not cried unto me with their heart, when they howled upon their beds
Though I have bound and strengthened their arms, yet do they imagine mischief against me.
They return, but not to the most High
