Give ear to my prayer, O God; and hide not thyself from my supplication.
Attend unto me, and hear me
Because of the voice of the enemy, because of the oppression of the wicked
My heart is sore pained within me
Fearfulness and trembling are come upon me, and horror hath overwhelmed me.
And I said, Oh that I had wings like a dove! for then would I fly away, and be at rest.
Lo, then would I wander far off, and remain in the wilderness. Selah.
I would hasten my escape from the windy storm and tempest.
Destroy, O Lord, and divide their tongues
Day and night they go about it upon the walls thereof
Wickedness is in the midst thereof
For it was not an enemy that reproached me; then I could have borne it
But it was thou, a man mine equal, my guide, and mine acquaintance.
We took sweet counsel together, and walked unto the house of God in company.
Let death seize upon them, and let them go down quick into hell
As for me, I will call upon God; and the LORD shall save me.
Evening, and morning, and at noon, will I pray, and cry aloud
He hath delivered my soul in peace from the battle that was against me
God shall hear, and afflict them, even he that abideth of old. Selah. Because they have no changes, therefore they fear not God.
He hath put forth his hands against such as be at peace with him
The words of his mouth were smoother than butter, but war was in his heart
Cast thy burden upon the LORD, and he shall sustain thee
But thou, O God, shalt bring them down into the pit of destruction
