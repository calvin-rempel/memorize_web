I waited patiently for the LORD; and he inclined unto me, and heard my cry.
He brought me up also out of an horrible pit, out of the miry clay, and set my feet upon a rock, and established my goings.
And he hath put a new song in my mouth, even praise unto our God
Blessed is that man that maketh the LORD his trust, and respecteth not the proud, nor such as turn aside to lies.
Many, O LORD my God, are thy wonderful works which thou hast done, and thy thoughts which are to us-ward
Sacrifice and offering thou didst not desire; mine ears hast thou opened
Then said I, Lo, I come
I delight to do thy will, O my God
I have preached righteousness in the great congregation
I have not hid thy righteousness within my heart; I have declared thy faithfulness and thy salvation
Withhold not thou thy tender mercies from me, O LORD
For innumerable evils have compassed me about
Be pleased, O LORD, to deliver me
Let them be ashamed and confounded together that seek after my soul to destroy it; let them be driven backward and put to shame that wish me evil.
Let them be desolate for a reward of their shame that say unto me, Aha, aha.
Let all those that seek thee rejoice and be glad in thee
But I am poor and needy; yet the Lord thinketh upon me
