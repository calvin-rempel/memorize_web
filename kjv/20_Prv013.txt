A wise son heareth his father's instruction
A man shall eat good by the fruit of his mouth
He that keepeth his mouth keepeth his life
The soul of the sluggard desireth, and hath nothing
A righteous man hateth lying
Righteousness keepeth him that is upright in the way
There is that maketh himself rich, yet hath nothing
The ransom of a man's life are his riches
The light of the righteous rejoiceth
Only by pride cometh contention
Wealth gotten by vanity shall be diminished
Hope deferred maketh the heart sick
Whoso despiseth the word shall be destroyed
The law of the wise is a fountain of life, to depart from the snares of death.
Good understanding giveth favour
Every prudent man dealeth with knowledge
A wicked messenger falleth into mischief
Poverty and shame shall be to him that refuseth instruction
The desire accomplished is sweet to the soul
He that walketh with wise men shall be wise
Evil pursueth sinners
A good man leaveth an inheritance to his children's children
Much food is in the tillage of the poor
He that spareth his rod hateth his son
The righteous eateth to the satisfying of his soul
