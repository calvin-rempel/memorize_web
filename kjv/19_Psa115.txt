Not unto us, O LORD, not unto us, but unto thy name give glory, for thy mercy, and for thy truth's sake.
Wherefore should the heathen say, Where is now their God?
But our God is in the heavens
Their idols are silver and gold, the work of men's hands.
They have mouths, but they speak not
They have ears, but they hear not
They have hands, but they handle not
They that make them are like unto them; so is every one that trusteth in them.
O Israel, trust thou in the LORD
O house of Aaron, trust in the LORD
Ye that fear the LORD, trust in the LORD
The LORD hath been mindful of us
He will bless them that fear the LORD, both small and great.
The LORD shall increase you more and more, you and your children.
Ye are blessed of the LORD which made heaven and earth.
The heaven, even the heavens, are the LORD's
The dead praise not the LORD, neither any that go down into silence.
But we will bless the LORD from this time forth and for evermore. Praise the LORD.
