I said, I will take heed to my ways, that I sin not with my tongue
I was dumb with silence, I held my peace, even from good; and my sorrow was stirred.
My heart was hot within me, while I was musing the fire burned
LORD, make me to know mine end, and the measure of my days, what it is
Behold, thou hast made my days as an handbreadth; and mine age is as nothing before thee
Surely every man walketh in a vain shew
And now, Lord, what wait I for? my hope is in thee.
Deliver me from all my transgressions
I was dumb, I opened not my mouth; because thou didst it.
Remove thy stroke away from me
When thou with rebukes dost correct man for iniquity, thou makest his beauty to consume away like a moth
Hear my prayer, O LORD, and give ear unto my cry; hold not thy peace at my tears
O spare me, that I may recover strength, before I go hence, and be no more.
