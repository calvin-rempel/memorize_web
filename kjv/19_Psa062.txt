Truly my soul waiteth upon God
He only is my rock and my salvation; he is my defence; I shall not be greatly moved.
How long will ye imagine mischief against a man? ye shall be slain all of you
They only consult to cast him down from his excellency
My soul, wait thou only upon God; for my expectation is from him.
He only is my rock and my salvation
In God is my salvation and my glory
Trust in him at all times; ye people, pour out your heart before him
Surely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie
Trust not in oppression, and become not vain in robbery
God hath spoken once; twice have I heard this; that power belongeth unto God.
Also unto thee, O Lord, belongeth mercy
